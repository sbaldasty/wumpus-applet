# Hunt the Wumpus

Gregory Yob invented **Hunt the Wumpus** in the early 1970's, a [simple text-based puzzle game](http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc2/showpage.php?page=244) that inspired many variations. This applet mimics a graphical variation for the [TI-99/4A Home Computer](http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc2/showpage.php?page=244). I wrote this back in 2004 for an undergraduate class. I just framed the code base in an Eclipse project, fixed all the compiler warnings, and uploaded a branch to Google Code... and now again to GitHub. Anybody want to host it?

Whatever documentation existed appears to be missing. I think you press the **S** key when you are ready to shoot, then choose the direction.
